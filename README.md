# Komputer-Store
JavaScript - Komputer Store Task

The Komputer Store is a webpage that allows the user to look at and "buy" different computers. 
The user can also "work" to earn money, which can be transferred to their bank balance.
The user can also (attempt to) "apply for a loan".

Prerequisites  
There are no specific prerequisites to use this website, as long as you have VS Code or similar.

Using the Komputer Store
1. Press the "work" button to add 100 "money" to the salary balance.
2. Press the "bank" button to transfer the total salary balance to the bank balance, which then resets the salary balance.  
   Note that if the salary balance is 0, you can't make a transfer.
4. Press the "get a loan" button to attempt to take a loan. The user will be prompted to input the amount they wish to loan.  
   If the loan is *less* than the bank balance multiplied by 2, the loan will be approved, and the corresponding amount will be added to the user's bank balance.  
   If the loan is *larger* than specified above, the request will be denied.  
   When a loan has been approved, the "get a loan" button will become disabled.  
5. Choose one of four different computers in the drop down menu to the upper right to see it's features, price, picture, and description.  
6. Press the "BUY NOW" button to (attempt to) buy a computer.  
   If the user's bank balance is *larger* than the computer's price, the purchase will be approved.  
   If the user's bank balance is *less* than the computer's price, the purchase will be declined.
